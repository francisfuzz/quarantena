A place to examine untrusted QR codes.

## Origin story

Over the last five years, I've noticed more and more QR codes pop up in public: billboards for learning more, restaurants for menus, and parking meters for payment. But, in the year 2023, it dawned on me that there's nothing to stop a malicious actor from putting their own QR code on top of completely legitimate ones, hijacking the client's device should they decide to open it in their own browser.

I'm creating this repository as a way to learn more about QR codes and how to deconstruct them in a "quarantined" zone. I'd love to get it to a place where this can be a part of a larger utility for public consumption where anyone can examine the QR code they come across before acting on it.

The name `quarantena` is the Latin word to which `quarantine` would later come on the scene in English. I didn't think `qr-tine` quite made the cut after finding a name like that. ðŸ˜‰
